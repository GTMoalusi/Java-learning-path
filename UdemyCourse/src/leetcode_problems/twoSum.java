        * Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
        * You many assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
        * You can return the answer in any order.
        *
        * Example1:
        * Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
        * Output: [0,1]
        * Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
        *
        * Example2:
        * Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
        * Output: [1,2]
        *
        * Example3:
        * Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
        * Output: [0,1]
        *
        * NB: Only one valid answer exists.
        * Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than 0(n(square)) time complexity?
