============= Week 4 of Month 1 =============
This week I dived deep into OOP, it has been really interesting to see my project come together, yes I have had to resort to asking
Claude and ChatGPT to assist me with building some logics and explaining concepts to me so that I can really understand. I have covered
externsively the concepts of OOP. Being Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction and Polymorphism on my project that I am working on (Hospital Management System).

I also learned about Collections Framework, HashMap, ArrayList, and HashSet. I also learned about List Interface. I must say that I still need to go through,
properly the Collections Framework and List Interfaces so that I can really consume the knowledge and understand them properly. 

I learned about Composition and why it is far better than Inheritance, when to use it and its flexibilities. I got to learn a little bit about dependencies but I still
need to revisit the topic because I am not so sure I understand them. I also learned about the difference between an abstract class and interface.

This week has really been challanging for me, I kept losing focus and I skipped a day of learning which I really didn't like it because it is breaking my momentum, however
it was actually good for me because I got to relax and clear my head. I didn't get to build as many mini projects I wanted to but I am going to schedule time to build them
so that I can renforce the concepts of OOP. I still have to learn how to properly debug my code and get used to doing it.

I am going to give myself a day in Month 2 and I will go through the concepts I am still not clear about and build projects so that I can get them.
