Week 1 of the 12 month journey I am taking. 
=====Day 1===== 
I went through the installation process and writing my first Java program of the famous "Hello World!". 
=====Day 2===== 
I learned about variables, data types and different operators. I also learned about logic operators. I built a basic Java calculator. 
I created a Git repository, and started commiting and pushing my work to my GitHub.
=====Day 3===== 
I learned about different types of loops, for loop, while loop, and do-while loop. 
for loop, we use it when we know how many times we want to loop for, "for(int index = 0; i <= 5; i++)", this loop will print numbers from 0 until 5. While loop, 
we use it when we don't know how many times we want to iterate/loop through our condition and if whether the condition is true or false, we loop until the condition is true, 
it is very important to not fall into an infinite loop. "while(index <= 5){System.out.println(i); i++;}", also index must be declared before using it in the loop. Do-while loop, 
when we don't know when the condition is true or false, but still want to run the code at least once we can use the do-while loop. It works the same as a traditional while loop, 
just that it will definitely run onces. I obviously need to put some effort into them so that I can start building pattern programs. This is a priority for me.
=====Day 4===== 
I learned about Arrays and User input handling I love arrays... and it is because they allow me to store multiple values of the same data type together inside one array variable. 
I build a temperature tracker program with hard coded values, and then optimized it to accept user input using the Scanner. 
I still want to spend more time building projects that involve array manipulations because I feel like they are very important especially for when I start working on DS&A projects. 
I also committed and pushed my temperature tracker project to my github repository I created called Java-learning-path.
=====Day 5===== 
I learnt about methods and using parameters inside my methods. I still need to put in some more work into this chapter because it is extremely important as it helps with cleaning my code,
knowing how to use them properly will really aid me with good coding practices, and not repeating the same code. I modified my day 2 project here, 
I refactored it by including methods for every operator selected by the user, and removed all the messy if-else statements that were initially in my main method. 
I still need to learn the importance of method overloading, and when to use it even though I would love to avoid overloading my methods. 
=====Day 6===== 
I am currently busy with my day 6 tasks, of Git and GitHub Mastery I am learning about branching, commits, pull/push, merge conflicts. 
I am also learning about the importance of documenting my learning process. I also want to learn about documenting my projects after working on them, and reading Java documentations. 
=====Day 7===== 
In my week 1, I have learnt the basics of Java and using git commands and github. Whats challenging for me is still working with Arrays and Methods, maybe also working with the loops properly. 
I plan to spend some time over the next coming days working of my challenges as I am a bit ahead of my learning journey. 
So the next couple of days I am going to drill deeper into learning Arrays, methods and using loops for my flow controls. 
Next week, which is week-2 I am starting with Object Oriented Programming, I am very excited but I am enjoying my journey.
